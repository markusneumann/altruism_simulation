macro:->This
is
another,
albeit
much
smaller
difference
to
at
least
some
of
the
literature,
in
which
players
are
selected
randomly,
as
opposed
to
everyone
getting
one
shot
at
the
game
per
round.
Conceptually,
this
really
makes
no
difference,
the
main
reason
I
handle
it
this
way
is
because
it
can
be
implemented
in
a
more
computationally
efficient
manner.
My
method
of
image
score
dissemination
is
quite
demanding
on
processing
resources,
so
efficiency
is
important.

macro:->The
main
reason
I
don't
continue
this

chain,
further
decreasing
the
probabilities
with

is
that
this
is
already
by
far
the
most
computationally
intensive
part
of
the
entire
simulation.

The

the

Unsurprisingly,
maintaining

larger

is
very
difficult
in
both
cases.
