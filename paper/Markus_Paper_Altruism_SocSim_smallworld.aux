\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Illustration of how information spreads throughout the network. The plot shows the reputation of the blue node among other members of the network. Grey nodes have never heard of the player (or have a neutral opinion), green nodes have a positive image of the blue player, whereas red nodes have a negative one. This figure illustrates that when information spreads in a contagion-based manner, closer nodes are more likely to receive the information.\relax }}{9}}
