# Replication Materials
This repository contains the replication materials for my working paper: 'One for all and all for one? Altruistic behavior, population size and network topology'.

R is the program of choice for this simulation. There are only two scripts:

'Markus_597_simulation.R' can be used to recreate any of the results by inputting the correct parameters (lines 40 to 56). At the end of the script, the results should be saved with an appropriate name.
The second R-script ('Markus_597_figures.R') takes these results and turns them into the figures in the paper.

Additionally, I have provided my results from the simulation script in an additional folder ('figures'). To recreate the figures directly from them, change the working directory in 'Markus_597_figures.R' to this folder and then run the rest of the script.
